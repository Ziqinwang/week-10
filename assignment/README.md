# Final Project Proposal

Your assignment this week is to write a detailed proposal for your final
project. In proposing your final, try to address each of the following
areas.

## Problem / Question

Applications are ultimately just tools. What problem or question does
your application attempt to resolve or grapple with? How does your
application speak to this problem/question?

I'm studying the community garden in new york city and analyze the spatial pattern of the gardens to see why they exist in certain areas and
to those vacant lot areas that do not have garden right now. How much of them can turn into community garden based on my analysis. '
I would think my application would give people clearly view how the community gardens are located in the city and why they are there. To those
neighborhood who suffer large proportion of vacant lots and want to change them to the garden. The application would suggest a number based on
the number of vacant lots these area has based on analysis model. and maybe more? I really need some advises.
## The data

Geospatial applications are all about working with data. What datasets
would you plan/like to use? If the data you'll be working with isn't
already stored in a way that you can use, how will you be storing your data?

Right now I have gather all the useful data and analysis model in new york city like land use, vacant lot, community gardens, subway lines and stations. All of
them are shapefile right now and I would transfer them to json file.
## Technologies used

Which technologies covered in class (or discovered on your own!) do you
plan to use? How do you anticipate using each of these technologies?

Review the APIs/online examples of leaflet, turf, jQuery, underscore (or
any library not explicitly covered in class) for functions/uses which
you'd like to explore. Briefly describe how you might use them.

I believe I would use them all( or mostly of them). The foundation would be based on leaflet or mapbox gl? I have not decided yet,
and I'm quite interested in how the APIs would do in my application ( really a big fan).
I also love to learn new staff as long as it plays well on my projects, really excited if you can show me new stuff.

## Design spec

#### User experience

At a high level, how do you expect people to use your application?
- Who are the users?
- What do they gain from your application' use?
- Are there any website/application examples in the wild to which you can compare your final?

I would think my user would be anyone interests in the land use change or the neighborhood development in new york city, which would
be local residents and city planner.
The planner would take this change to adjust the land use in certain areas and local would check the vacant lot in the neighborhood and
turn them into gardens that do good to the community.

#### Layouts and visual design

So far, we've built all our applications with a side bar for
representing non-map content and navigation. This is not the only
successful design. Extra content could be displayed in a top bar,
through modals, through side bars on both sides, and any combination of
these as well as a number not mentioned. Try to describe your
application's visual layout. Conceptually (no need for extensive CSS
here), what will this design require?

My ideal visual layout would be a whole page map with some description sidebar, and graph(maybe animate graph) on the sides. The whole
thing would be in one page so there would be no slide. People can drag and zoom to check the map and ty

## Anticipated difficulties

Thinking about weaknesses can be useful. What do you anticipate being
most difficult about this project? How will you attempt to cope with
these difficulties? For example, asynchronous behavior (ajax, events)
are hard to use and think about. Global variables are a strategy for
coping with that difficulty by breaking data out of the asynchronous
context.

The difficulty of the project might be the propose. How would my application helps in the real world, and that is like to
influence how I design the tools I will use to develope the web application. As to the technology part, I feel like it would
be hard to wrap all the things together and make it neat and clean. That will be a big challenge.

## Missing pieces

We've only managed to scratch the surface of the available technologies
by which you could construct an application. What use-cases haven't we covered
that you think would be useful? What technologies not covered seem exciting to
you (you don't necessarily have to fully understand what they're for,
this is a chance for you to get our help interpreting a technology's
purpose/usage).

I'm really interested in how the mapbox api used in navigation or route choice, but the document is quite confusing
and I don't figure out exactly. It would be great if we can talk about that if that api is free for use. Also the animation
of a point along the route is quite amazing and I would like to learn more about the animation part of the web application.
